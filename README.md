# spog-the-dog

Spog is a 4 legged robot leg modelled after Boston Dynamic's Spot. 

Spog can:
- Walk forward, backward
- Turn left and right
- Forward object detection
- Dance (if you call stepping forward and backwards repeatedly a dance)

Unfortunately, Spog also:
- Can't get up after falling
- Can't carry anything
- Can't climb stairs

I guess that's the tradeoff of having a LEGO robot dog built over 5 weeks instead of a $70,000 robot dog.
